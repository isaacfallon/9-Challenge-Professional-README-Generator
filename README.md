# 9-Challenge-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

This project is a README generator application using the Node.JS command line interface ['inquirer'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). It serves as the week 9 challenge for The University of Sydney's Coding Bootcamp.

This application was built to serve as a more efficient  way to create a README.md file for a project. 

By using this README generator, the user does not need to manually enter in the details for their README file which solves a problem of possibly creating an inaccurate or subpar README file to describe their project.

By building this project, I gained a solid understanding of how Node.JS functions and the importance of README files for a project. 

### Video showing how the application works:

To understand how the application runs and view a sample README file generated, please watch [a video demonstration here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Via0LklNxTisbEY8yMAe3ezf6Gls7_jQ/view).

## Usage

To use this application, you'll need to firstly, clone the repository and run the project locally. [Refer to this guide from GitHub if you need help.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository/)

Once cloned, you will need to navigate to the project's folder in your terminal and run the command 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies. 

Once the installation has completed, enter the command 'node index.js' to run the application. Once all prompts are answered, a new README_SAMPLE.md file should be generated in your project file.
